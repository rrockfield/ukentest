# Uken Backend Engineer Challenges

## Question 1

NOTE: This is my very first time working with Redis, please don't expect an expert level on this tool.

### Challenge A

In the test files you may find a class [ChallengeA_IT](src/test/java/com/uken/rockfield/question1/ChallengeA_IT.java). 
This class contains 4 tests:
- consecutiveInsertionTest
- singleTransactionInsertionTest
- singlePipelineInsertionTest
- parallelPipelineInsertionTest

#### consecutiveInsertionTest (ignored and deprecated): 
This is pretty much the same test you posted in the example. 
It is ignored and deprecated in order to avoid the execution when testing the selected methods.

#### singleTransactionInsertionTest: 
My first attempt to solve the problem was including all of the insertions in a single transaction operation. 
The time gain was worth it, as I was able to get all the operations done in approximately 45 seconds to a remote Redis.

#### singlePipelineInsertionTest: 
My second attempt to improve performance was replacing the transaction with a pipeline to see if Redis was adding some overhead to the transaction in case of an unexpected rollback. 
The time gain was negligible, barely 1 second over 100000 insertions.

#### parallelPipelineInsertionTest (ignored): 
My last attempt to improve performance was applying divide and conquer with local parallelism.
Unexpectedly, the 10 threads I used lasted even more than the single pipeline test, and that's the reason why this test was marked as ignored.

### Challenge B

In the test files you may find a class [ChallengeB_IT](src/test/java/com/uken/rockfield/question1/ChallengeB_IT.java). 

My solution was to add a [buffer](src/main/java/com/uken/rockfield/question1/RedisBuffer.java) before sending the insertion to Redis. 
The [buffer](src/main/java/com/uken/rockfield/question1/RedisBuffer.java) is supposed to hold all of the insertions in a temporary map until the timer triggers.
The timer executes all of the insertions saved in the map in a single Redis pipeline using a parallel thread, meanwhile the main thread replaces the map instance with a brand new one.
The [test](src/test/java/com/uken/rockfield/question1/ChallengeB_IT.java) executes a single thread for testing the functionality only, a proper load test is still required to measure the throughput.

## Question 2

TBD

## Question 3

There are no validations, so for the sake of my solution I'm assuming that:
1. Time ranges are surrounded with parentheses, starting with "(" and ending with ")".
2. Starting time is separated from ending time with a dash ("-").
3. Time ranges are separated by commas (",").
4. Time ranges are in ascending order and don't overlap.
5. Time starts at 0:00 and ends at 24:00

The test values are executed from [TimeRangeSubstractionTest](src/test/java/com/uken/rockfield/question3/TimeRangeSubstractionTest.java) as proposed by the challenge. However a new custom test was added: MultiSplitTest.

The main class [TimeRangeSubstraction](src/main/java/com/uken/rockfield/question3/TimeRangeSubstraction.java) implements a static method as the entry point:

String substraction(String minuend, String subtrahend)

The solution transforms the time strings into [TimeRange](src/main/java/com/uken/rockfield/question3/TimeRange.java) objects. This object implements a binary tree whenever a time range is split by the substraction, otherwise it behaves as a single range.
